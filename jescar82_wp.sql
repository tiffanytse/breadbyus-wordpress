We believe a bakery isn’t quite complete without the smells and tastes of exceptional coffee, so we offer Hintonburg’s own Happy Goat coffee at our cozy espresso bar.\r\n\r\nWe are serious about what we like – bread and coffee – and aim to give you the best loaf and brew that we can.\r\n\r\nWe strive to give customers the sensory experience of a bakery full of aromatic breads of many varieties, with beautiful esthetics, every day. Our menu is simple and that’s how we like it. Our approach to bread is to respect the inherent properties and potential of the grains. Nature provides us with so many wonderful varieties of wheat and grains, so we try not to mess with it too much. Our slow and thoughtful techniques are meant to extract the complex and wonderful trapped flavour potential of the grains themselves. We are a back-to-basics kind of place. Straightforward, delicious, and consistent.\r\n\r\nWe do our best to support local suppliers because we love our home and we love the bounty that comes from it.

Our commitment to living wages, organic flour, and directly traded coffee means we need to get creative in fulfilling this mission.\r\n\r\nLuckily there are other folks out there who are also pondering this conundrum. One of the ways you can help us with our mission is to participate in the growing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SuspendedCoffeess">Suspended Coffee </a>movement. The idea is simple; if you are picking up your loaf or cup of coffee, and you have some spare change, buy a second one and leave it in the store.

Sharing good bread that is both delicious and accessible is her goal. Our approach to bread is to respect the inherent properties and potential of the grains. Nature provides us with so many wonderful varieties of wheat and grains, so we try not to mess with it too much. Our slow and thoughtful techniques are meant to extract the complex and wonderful trapped flavour potential of the grains themselves. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On any given day, you are likely to see most of the staples: croissants first thing in the morning, followed by big crusty country loaves, followed by baguettes, rye loaves, whole wheat, and Jess'' favourite - focaccia around lunch time. And then depending on the day of the week, we will be showcasing some more special varieties - whole spelt, luxurious brioche, milk bread, nut and seed breads, ciabatta, olive bread (extra olives of course), and rolls. </p>[/one_half]\r\n\r\n<center><h5>Just so you know...</center></h5>\r\n[one_half_last]<p>In our bakery, sourdough isn''t just an option, it is the way. So to some extent, almost every loaf will come to life with the help of our sourdough culture. In some breads, the sourness will be the star; in others, it will be subtle or barely detectable. Sourness is not only great for surprising and complex flavour, but it also helps our breads last longer without adding any preservatives, even when there in just small quantities. </p>[/one_half_last]\r\n\r\n', 'BREAD', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '29-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-12-04 03:30:58', '2013-12-04 03:30:58', '', 29, 'http://breadbyus.com/?p=135', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
